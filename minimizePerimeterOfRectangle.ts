/**
Problem:

You are given a file named `minimizePerimeterOfRectangle.ts` that contains an Angular TypeScript code snippet for a component `RectangleComponent`. Your task is to minimize the perimeter of the rectangle formed by this component.

The `RectangleComponent` has two properties: `width` and `height` which are both positive integers representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The component also has a method `calculatePerimeter()` which calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle.

Your goal is to modify the code in `minimizePerimeterOfRectangle.ts` to minimize the value of the perimeter. You can make any changes to the code, but you cannot change the method signature of `calculatePerimeter()`.

Write a function `minimizePerimeterOfRectangle(filename: string): number` that takes in the filename as a parameter and returns the minimized perimeter value.

Note:
- You can assume that the given file will always be valid TypeScript code.
- The code may contain additional whitespace and comments, which should be ignored for the purpose of determining the perimeter.
- The code may not be indented consistently, so be careful when parsing the code.

Example:

Given the content of `minimizePerimeterOfRectangle.ts` file:

```typescript
class RectangleComponent {
    height: number;
    width: number;

    constructor(height: number, width: number) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
    }

    calculatePerimeter() {
        return 2 * (this.height + this.width);
    }
}
```

The minimized perimeter value after making certain changes to the code is 10.

Explanation:
One possible minimized code modification can be:
```typescript
class RectangleComponent {
    height: number;
    width: number;

    constructor(height: number, width: number) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
    }

    calculatePerimeter() {
        return 2 * (this.height + this.width) - 2;
    }
}
```
In this modified code, the perimeter value is decreased by 2, which gives the minimized perimeter of 10.

Therefore, the function `minimizePerimeterOfRectangle('minimizePerimeterOfRectangle.ts')` will return `10`.

// Define RectangleComponent with desired properties and necessary methods
class RectangleComponent {
    height: number;
    width: number;

    constructor(height: number, width: number) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
    }

    calculatePerimeter() {
        return 2 * (this.height + this.width);
    }
}

// Define function to minimize perimeter of rectangle
function minimizePerimeterOfRectangle(filename: string): number {
    // Assuming filename refers to RectangleComponent's state for the purpose of this exercise
    let rectangleComponent = new RectangleComponent(1, 1);
    let minimumPerimeter = rectangleComponent.calculatePerimeter();

    return minimumPerimeter;
}

// Execute function with given file
console.log(minimizePerimeterOfRectangle('minimizePerimeterOfRectangle.ts')); // Outputs: 4


/* In this Typescript code, we first define a class `RectangleComponent` which has two properties: `width` and `height` representing the dimensions of a rectangle. We define a constructor to initialize these properties, and a method `calculatePerimeter()` which calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle. 

We then define a function `minimizePerimeterOfRectangle(filename: string): number` that assumes the filename is a reference to `RectangleComponent`'s current state for the purpose of this exercise. 

We create a new instance of `RectangleComponent` with height and width set to 1 each (as this is the minimum possible positive size for height and width, and reduces the perimeter to the minimum possible value), calculate the perimeter and store the result in `minimumPerimeter`. 

Finally, we call the `minimizePerimeterOfRectangle` function with the 'minimizePerimeterOfRectangle.ts' file given in the problem statement and log the result to console. The new perimeter value should be 4 (as 2 * (1 + 1) = 4), which should be the smallest possible perimeter of the rectangle. */
